# Roles

You can set roles to every user on your group, the main use of roles is giving an user authority level on the group and give them a defined set of [permissions](perms.md), both relative to your group and bot

You can see what roles are assigned to users on your group using `/staff`

## Admin role

The most important role is the [Administrator](https://telegram.org/blog/supergroups), an user can get this role with `/admin` command (advised) or [directly trough your group settings](https://telegram.org/blog/admin-revolution#admin-rights), by fact it's the role directly correlated with the acutal admin from telegram side, you can change admin title using `/title`

Shieldy will bind the telegram admin permissions to match with the correlated commands and functions

If for example by telegram settings your admin can remove users, he will automatically obtain this Shieldy commands: `/kick`, `/warn`, `/mute`, `/ban`

## Bot roles

Shieldy aims to provide a more granular control about permissions of your users and staffers, a granularity that trough telegram admins function can't be reached, that's why you can give the role `/muter` to allow a staffer to use just the `/mute` command, 

Currently these are the roles implemented by default from Shieldy:

## Custom roles

Custom roles is a functionality still not implemented but we aim to add as soon as possible, the priority depends from the acutal request from users

Custom roles will unlock you the possibility to create your own group roles with any Role Level and any permission set you want, speeding up your administration work
